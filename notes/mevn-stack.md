# MEVN Stack Development

## Introduction

MEVN stack stands for `MongoDB, Express, VueJS, NodeJS` and is used to describe web development not using `React` or `Angular` but the slightly newer `VueJS`.

VueJS attempts to take the best of both `React` and `Angular` and avoid some of their mistakes.

VueJS has become very popular in recent years particularly with companies not committed to the `React` stack.
