# A place for learning VueJS

Here is a learning repository for learning basic VueJS.

There are two folders

1) Single HTML files which import VueJS as a library, and show individual features

2) Vue CLI 3 standalone projects which can deploy, but are just posted here as static files.  Built with @vue/cli
