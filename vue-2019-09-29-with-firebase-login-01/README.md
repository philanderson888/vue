# vue-2019-09-29-with-firebase-login-01

This is another attempt to build from scratch a very basic vue application tapping into a Firebase database.  The topic will be just to build a simple login application.

In this version I am using Typescript and also I am using Chai testing as I am not too sure how to run and set up testing, so this is one thing I want to look at.
