# vue-08-routing-02

> This is following UDEMY Max and is doing the part with routing.  This time I am building from scratch and attempting to copy his video exactly ie have a routing.js file instead of what the scaffolding builds for me

This is starting at lecture 224

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
