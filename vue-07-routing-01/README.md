# vue-07-routing-01

> A starter project following Udemy course with Maximilan.  In the routing section at the start.  Section 16 Lecture 224.

This actually uses the default vue-client setup with routing to get the routes that I want, not actually the setup provided in the course, since the vue-client had the routes bundled already with it.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
