Goal : to build a simple Vue app with Firebase to 
    a) Login
    b) View A List Of Usernames

This project has a lot in it

1) Axios to get JSON data from an API
2) Typescript although I didn't implement classes
3) Components
4) Props and passing data to components
5) Local Storage
6) Global counters ie a button which works on different pages and stored also in localStorage
7) Iterating a list obtained as JSON from the API on the screen
