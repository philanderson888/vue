## Instructions for use

The project has been set up with the following functionality

  -   Read existing shopping list items from Firebase database to local array and display
  -   Post new shopping list items to local array and Firebase
  -   Delete existing items from local array and Firebase
  
Just due to limitations of time I have not included the final CRUD item ie permitting dynamic updates to local array and Firebase.
