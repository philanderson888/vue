# Standalone Projects

This repo has various Vue projects built

## OKTA Authentication

This was a project which I had set myself to learn VueJS Athentication learning with OKTA as the authentication method.

To enhance my learning I determined that I would build each repo again from scratch each time I came to the project, just to reinforce my own learning and to increase the speed at which I could code.
